Strings

You can use single or double quotes to call a string. However, there is a time and place for each
For example, if you have an apostrophe in your string, you cant use single quotes
Same goes with the for statement
It's the same vice versa as well, for example if you want quotation marks in your string
If you want to define a string that has multiple lines, use triple quotes ''' '''
We can use square brackets to get a character at a given index in a string
You can also use a negative index which goes back to the end of the string
A string's characters start from 0
You can also use a colon to call a group of indexes
When using colons, if you leave nothing there, it interprets it as 0
