Arithmetic Operations

The same operations that we have in math
These operations are: +, -, *, **, /, //, !=, ==, <, <=, >, >=, %,
We also have an augmented assignment operator. This is if you want to increment a variable
Do this by using the +=
You can also do this by declaring a variable to the original variable and adding another operator.

Operator Precedence

In python, if you use different operators in a single equation it uses PEMDAS/BEDMAS to determine it.
Just like PEMDAS, you can use brackets to do the equation in brackets first.
