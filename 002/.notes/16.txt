For Loops

We can initiate a for loop using the for statement followed by a variable
From here you can do things such as call a string and use the in statement
If you were to print that variable in the for loop block you would get the characters in the string horizontal
This can be used for lists
You can also use square brackets to define a list
When using the range function, the range starts at 0 rather than 1
