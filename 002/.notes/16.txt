For Loops

We use for loops to iterate items over a collection, such as a string
We can iterate over characters in a string using a for loop, and do something with it.
We can initiate a for loop using the for statement followed by a variable
When you type for and then the loop variable, it has multiple iterations. In each one, it holds one item of information.
From here you can do things such as call a string and use the in statement
If you were to print that variable in the for loop block you would get the characters in the string horizontal
This can be used for lists
You can also use square brackets to define a list
When using the range function, the range starts at 0 rather than 1
