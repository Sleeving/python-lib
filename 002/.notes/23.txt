Dictionaries

We use dictionaries in python to store data that comes in key-valued pairs.
An example of a key-valued pair is a phone number and email and name
we use dictionaries to store information those key values.
To look at it, each definition in a dictionary is printed only one time, which is why you cant have multiple items in a dictionary
