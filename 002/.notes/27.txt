Keyword Arguments

Arguments in positions matter when working with functions. Thats why theyre called positional arguments.
There are also keyword arguments, they come out with the same result regardless of the position theyre in.
For the most part, use positional arguments, but when sometimes working with numerical variables, use keyword arguments
Dont mix positional and keyword arguments, if the keyword argument is already in the front.
