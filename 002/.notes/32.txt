Classes

We use classes to define new types
Basic types are numbers, string, and boolean
We can use classes to define new types to model real world items
Capitalize new class names
Once we're done with defining our class, we can start with our objects
The class creates the blueprint for the objects or instances
Then we can use attributes that we can use in our programs
