String Methods

We use the 'len' tag to show the amount of characters in a string.
This is useful when we receive input from a user
For example, when signing up for a site, we can use the len function to call how many characters are in a name
From there you can do things like put a character limit
the in expression is a boolean expression that determines if your condition is correct
You can call variables by using dots
